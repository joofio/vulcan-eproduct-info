Humalog Mix50 is a premixed suspension. Its active substance is insulin lispro. 50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is dissolved in water and it works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly. 50% of the insulin lispro in Humalog Mix50 is available in a suspension together with protamine sulphate, so that its action is prolonged. You get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood. Humalog Mix50 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term. Humalog Mix50 works very quickly and longer than soluble insulin. You should normally use Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. Your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Mix50 as well as a longer-acting insulin. Each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it. Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. Be very careful if you do change insulin.</div></div>"

Make sure you get the Humalog Mix50 that your doctor has told you to use.</li><li>If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy, you may not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low. Warning signs are listed later in this leaflet. You must think carefully about when to have your meals, how often to exercise and how much to do. You must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood glucose often.</li><li>A few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different. If you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them, please discuss this with your doctor.</li><li>If you answer YES to any of the following questions, tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse<ul><li>Have you recently become ill?</li><li>Do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver?</li><li>Are you exercising more than usual?</li></ul></li><li>The amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol.</li><li>You should also tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad. The time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals at different times from when you are at home.</li><li>Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible, if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema).</li></ul><p><strong>Skin changes at the injection site</strong></p><p>The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (See How to use Humalog Mix50). Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose.</p><p><strong>Other medicines and Humalog Mix50</strong></p><p>Your insulin needs may change if you are taking</p><ul><li>the contraceptive pill,</li><li>steroids,</li><li>thyroid hormone replacement therapy,</li><li>oral hypoglycaemics,</li><li>acetyl salicylic acid,</li><li>sulpha antibiotics,</li><li>octreotide,</li><li>“beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline),</li><li>beta-blockers, or</li><li>some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors),</li><li>danazol,</li><li>some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and</li><li>angiotensin II receptor blockers.

How to use Humalog Mix50</b><p><strong>Dose</strong></p><ul><li>You should normally inject Humalog Mix50 within 15 minutes of a meal. If you need to, you can inject soon after a meal. But your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use, when to use it, and how often. These instructions are only for you. Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly.</li><li>If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a Humalog product), you may have to take more or less than before. This might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months.</li><li>Inject Humalog Mix50 under the skin. You should not administer it using a different administration route. Under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously.</li></ul><p><strong>Preparing Humalog Mix50</strong></p><ul><li>Cartridges containing Humalog Mix50 should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180° ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky. If not, repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed. Cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing. Do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose. The cartridges should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself.</li></ul><p><strong>Getting the pen ready to use</strong></p><ul><li>First wash your hands. Disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge.</li><li>You must only use Humalog Mix50 cartridges in Lilly insulin pens. Please make sure that Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen. The 3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen.</li><li>Follow the instructions that come with the pen. Put the cartridge into the pen.</li><li>You will set the dose to 1 or 2 units. Then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top. With the pen still pointing up, press the injection mechanism. Do this until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen. These are harmless, but if the air bubble is too big, it may make the dose of your injection less accurate. Injecting Humalog Mix50</li><li>Before you make an injection, clean your skin as you have been instructed. Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. After your injection, leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose. Do not rub the area you have just injected. Make sure you inject at least half an inch (1 cm) from the last injection and that you ‘rotate’ the places you inject, as you have been taught.</li></ul><p><strong>After injecting</strong></p><ul><li>As soon as you have done the injection, take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap. This will keep the Humalog Mix50 sterile and prevent leaking. It will also stop air going back into the pen and the needle clogging up. Do not share your needles. Do not share your pen. Replace the cap on your pen. Leave the cartridge in the pen.</li></ul><p><strong>Further injections</strong></p><ul><li>Before every injection, dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing up until a drop of Humalog Mix50 comes out of the needle. You can see how much Humalog is left by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge. The distance between each mark on the gauge is about 20 units. If there is not enough for your dose, change the cartridge.</li></ul><p><strong>Do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog Mix50 cartridge. Once the cartridge is empty, do not use it again.</strong></p><p><strong>If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you should</strong> If you use more Humalog Mix50 than you need or are unsure how much you have injected, a low blood sugar may occur. Check your blood sugar.</p><p>If your blood sugar is low (<strong>mild hypoglycaemia</strong>), eat glucose tablets, sugar or drink a sugary drink. Then eat fruit, biscuits, or a sandwich, as your doctor has advised you and have some rest. This will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose. If you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale, tell your doctor at once. A glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia.

How to store Humalog Mix50</strong></p><p>Before the first use store your Humalog Mix50 in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep your cartridge in use at room temperature (below 30°C) and discard after 28 days. Do not put it near heat or in the sun. Do not keep your pen or the cartridges you are using in the fridge. The pen with the inserted cartridge should not be stored with the needle attached. Keep out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the label and the carton. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. Do not use this medicine if you notice clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge, giving it a frosted appearance. Check each time you inject yourself. Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required. These measures will help to protect the environment.</p></div></div>"

Insulin lispro is made in the laboratory by a ‘recombinant DNA technology’ process. It is a changed form of human insulin and so is different from other human and animal insulins. Insulin lispro is closely related to human insulin which is a natural hormone made by the pancreas. The other ingredients are protamine sulphate, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, dibasic sodium phosphate 7H2O, zinc oxide and water for injection. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may have been used to adjust the acidity.</p></div></div>"
